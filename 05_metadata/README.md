## Memo

Include theses considerations/references:

- [Metadata are the unexploited treasures of geoservices like WMS WFS WMTS](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidoesch_metadata-geoservices-geodata-activity-7004912567185719296-L-C6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
- [La standardisation des données ouvertes: favoriser l’interopérabilité, accroître l’impact de l’Open Data](https://nextcloud.datactivist.coop/s/8x3RzHjrRx29R3y/download/Cahier%20Data%20Publica%20#2%20Standardisation.pdf)

> **_QUESTION:_** What does eCH-0056 say about the metadata associated with a geoservice? Can they be included in the service or should they be included in a separate CSW service? Couldn't we opt for the second option and mention that a link to the associated metadata service should be included in the service definition?
