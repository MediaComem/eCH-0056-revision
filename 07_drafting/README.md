## Introduction

The meeting starts with a discussion on the proposed changes and comments on the eCH-0056 V.4.0 (draft) document that have been made by the participants.
## eCH-0056 V.4.0 (draft)

The working group was able to cover the following parts of the document:

- Einleitung
- Normative Referenzen
- Richtlinien und Empfehlungen
    - Allgemeine Regeln
    - Sicherheit
    - Sprache
    - Metadaten
    - Koordinatensysteme
    - Schweizer CH1903+ Tile Matrix Set
    - Qualit√§t
    - Darstellungsdienste

The rest will be discussed at a future meeting on 26.05.2023.

## Publication process and proposed new structure of the document

Jens and Maxime presented a new option for publishing the document based on GitHub and [Metanorma](https://www.metanorma.org/).
Those present were in favour of this option and it was approved.

Jens and Maxime went on to present thoughts on separating the document into a main part and normative annexes specific to each category of standards as is the case for INSPIRE (see [example](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features/blob/master/spec/oapif-inspire-download.md)).
This option was not considered satisfactory by those present. It was therefore rejected.

Maxime then proposed to define requirements classes by category of standards (WMS, WFS, OGC API Features) and to link them to the corresponding international standards. A POC based on the WMS will be carried out and presented at the next workshop.

## Conclusion

The meeting ended at around 15:00.
The CPT members would like to warmly thank all the stakeholders for their active participation and look forward to future exchanges in the revision of the eCH-0056 standard.
